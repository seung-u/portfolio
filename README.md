# My Portfolio

> Hello! Today I would like to introduce my portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Next.js is a React framework, and Tailwind CSS is a CSS library. By using both of them together, I was able to create a responsive website quickly and easily.

#Features
-Home page: A landing page that provides an overview of the portfolio. This page introduces myself and briefly explains the tech stack that I used.

-Projects page: A page that showcases the projects that I have worked on. Each project is introduced with a brief description and a link to the live site or repository.

-Contact page: A page that provides my contact information. Here, visitors can find my email address and social media accounts.

-Design: The design of the portfolio website was implemented using Tailwind CSS. Although Tailwind CSS is a CSS library, it includes a design system, making it easy to create a cohesive design. In this portfolio, I implemented the color palette, typography, grid, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
